FEMUR AND TIBIA SEGMENTATION, EXPANSION, AND ANATOMICAL LANDMARK EXTRACTION FROM 3D CT IMAGES

This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for segmenting the femur and tibia from 3D CT scans, applying morphological expansions, and extracting key anatomical landmarks. The pipeline is designed for use in biomechanical modeling, orthopedic planning, and medical research.

---

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

- Segment femur and tibia masks from labeled CT volumes.
- Perform fixed and randomized morphological expansions of bone masks.
- Extract anatomical landmarks: medial and lateral lowest tibial surface points.
- Provide reusable and extensible code with preserved spatial accuracy.

   source venv/bin/activate  (On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate)

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## ðŸ“Š Results

- Accurate binary masks for femur and tibia.
- Fixed dilation masks (2mm and 4mm).
- Realistic randomized expansions simulating biological variability.
- Medial/lateral lowest tibial points extracted with spatial fidelity.
